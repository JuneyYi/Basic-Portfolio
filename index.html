    <img src="https://studybreaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sb1.jpg" alt=" sponge bob">

    <p1>First off i would like to start by thanking you for taking the time to read this about me page. I started on this journey of learning how to code to further better myself and to,hopefully one day, get a job in the web development field.</p1>

    <p2>This journey started when my father told me to look for a career. He pushed me towards many different fields but i had no interest in them. He then one day told me to look into a coding boot camp and that might be right up my alley.</p2>

    <p3>I am glad ive finally started on a path that one day will bear fruit and give me a future ive always dreamed of. So far coding sounds like an alien language but I will stay strong and try my best. Heres to the future!!!!</p3>
